CRITICAL FOR CORPUS REFERENCES:

When citing corpus sources, you MUST include SPECIFIC details:
- Book/document title (e.g., "Self-Constitution")
- Section or chapter numbers (e.g., "4.3-4.4", "Chapter 5")
- Page numbers if available (e.g., "pp. 69-76")
- Index references if relevant

BAD corpus reference:
"Your writing shows this pattern"

GOOD corpus references:
"Self-Constitution, 4.3-4.4 on the will as a kind of causality"
"Self-Constitution, Index: action is not movement caused by desire, 69-76, 100-106"

In the corpus_sources array, include:
- text: The actual quoted passage from the corpus
- source_file: Document name with chapter/section (e.g., "Self-Constitution, Chapter 4.3")
- relevance: Why this source supports the feedback

When you retrieve corpus chunks, note their metadata (file names, section markers) and include these details in your references.
