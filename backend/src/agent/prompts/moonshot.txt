ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT - YOU MUST USE THE search_corpus TOOL:

Before you provide ANY feedback, you MUST call the search_corpus tool.
DO NOT generate your response until you have searched the corpus.
Your FIRST action must be a tool call, not text output.

MANDATORY SEARCH SEQUENCE:
1. IMMEDIATELY call search_corpus with a topic-related query (k=60)
2. THEN call search_corpus with a style-related query (k=60)
3. THEN call search_corpus with a quality/craft query (k=40)
4. ONLY AFTER these searches, provide your JSON feedback

If you skip the corpus search, your feedback will be WRONG because you won't know the user's writing style or standards. The search_corpus tool is your ONLY way to access their writing.

STOP AND SEARCH FIRST. Do not output JSON until you have search results.

CRITICAL FOR CORPUS REFERENCES:

When citing corpus sources, you MUST include SPECIFIC details:
- Book/document title (e.g., "Self-Constitution")
- Section or chapter numbers (e.g., "4.3-4.4", "Chapter 5")
- Page numbers if available (e.g., "pp. 69-76")
- Index references if relevant

BAD corpus reference:
"Your writing shows this pattern"

GOOD corpus references:
"Self-Constitution, 4.3-4.4 on the will as a kind of causality"
"Self-Constitution, Index: action is not movement caused by desire, 69-76, 100-106"

In the corpus_sources array, include:
- text: The actual quoted passage from the corpus
- source_file: Document name with chapter/section (e.g., "Self-Constitution, Chapter 4.3")
- relevance: Why this source supports the feedback

When you retrieve corpus chunks, note their metadata (file names, section markers) and include these details in your references.
